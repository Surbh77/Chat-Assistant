#Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to using your AI chat assistant:

##Launch the Chat Assistant:
Open the chat assistant application on your device.

##Select Default Language Model (LLM):
On the side panel, choose the default language model (LLM) from the available options: GPT-3.4 Turbo, GPT-4, Llama-2, or Mistral.

##Initiate a Conversation:
Start the conversation by typing your message or query in the chat interface. The selected LLM will respond based on the input.

##Observe Formal Responses:
Notice that the responses from the selected LLM are formal, and tailored to the appropriate context. This is achieved through careful prompting designed to guide the language model's output.

##Switching Models (Optional):
If needed, you can switch to a different model mid-conversation by selecting another one from the side panel. This can help tailor responses based on the strengths and characteristics of each model.

##Reference Previous Conversations:
As the conversation progresses, the chat assistant remembers the context and information provided earlier. This allows for more coherent and context-aware responses.

##Test Memory Recall:
Towards the end of the conversation, test the chat assistant's memory recall by referring to the information mentioned earlier. For example, ask about your name or a specific detail from a previous message.

##Evaluate Suggestions:
Observe how the chat assistant suggests information based on the remembered context. In your example, the model remembered your name and suggested two surnames, showcasing its ability to maintain context throughout the conversation.

##Provide Feedback (Optional):
If the response requires improvement or clarification, you can provide feedback to help enhance the chat assistant's performance. This may involve refining prompts or adjusting the way information is presented.

##End the Conversation:
Conclude the conversation when you have received the information or assistance you need. The chat assistant retains the conversation context for a more personalized and continuous user experience in future interactions.

By following these steps, users can effectively use your AI chat assistant, benefiting from its ability to remember context, offer formal responses, and seamlessly switch between different language models based on their preferences or specific requirements.
